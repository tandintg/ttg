                <h1 class="aa">What is AI</h1>
                <p class="zero">AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that
                    typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, perception, and decision-making. AI is revolutionizing many industries, including healthcare, education, finance, and transportation.
                    <br><br>
                    AI systems are categorized into two types:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> Designed for specific tasks like language translation, facial recognition, and virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa).</li>
                        <li><strong>General AI:</strong> Still in development, it aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.</li>
                    </ul>
                    An AI language refers to the technology behind systems like CHATgpt, known as natural language processing (NLP) or natural language understanding (NLU). These systems are designed to understand, generate, and respond to human language in a way that mimics natural conversation.

                    Bhutan is a small country with a GDP of about 2.5 billion USD, sandwiched between two giant countries in the Himalayan region. Bhutan has a population of about 700,000 people, more than half of which are farmers, making agriculture a fundamental factor of Bhutan.
                    <br><br>
                    Bhutan is renowned for its unique approach to development, focusing on Gross National Happiness (GNH) rather than just economic growth. This holistic approach prioritizes sustainable development, environmental conservation, and the well-being of its citizens. The country has also become a global leader in conservation, with over 70% of its land covered by forests.

                    Bhutan is slowly embracing the potential of AI and technology. While still in the early stages of integrating AI systems into various sectors, the country has recognized its potential to drive innovation and solve local challenges. AI could play a key role in areas such as healthcare, education, and agriculture, helping to optimize services and provide solutions that are tailored to Bhutan's unique needs. For instance, AI can aid in monitoring crops, predicting weather patterns for farmers, and even enhancing remote healthcare by diagnosing diseases through AI-driven tools.
                    <br><br>
                    As Bhutan continues to develop its technological infrastructure, AI adoption is expected to rise, contributing to both economic growth and improved quality of life. The government and local tech communities are working together to ensure that AI is introduced in a way that complements Bhutan's values of sustainability and happiness.
